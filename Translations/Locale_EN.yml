# Some lines supports option to send them to custom places, like action bar, title, sub title or even create JSON/clickable messages
# If line starts with !toast! then player will get toast message (advancement popup, only 1.12 and up). Some extra variables can be used to define type and icon. example: !toast! -t:goal -icon:paper Hello world!
# If line starts with !actionbar! then player will get action bar message defined after this variable
# If line starts with !actionbar:[seconds]! then player will get action bar message for defined amount of time
# If line starts with !broadcast! then everyone will receive message. You can add extra !toast! !actionbar! or !title! to send message for everyone to specific place, in example !broadcast!!title!
# If line starts with !customtext:[cTextName]! then custom text will be taken by name provided and shown for player. In case its used after !broadcast! then everyone who is online will get this custom text message
# If line starts with !title! then player will get title message defined after this variable, in addition it can contain !subtitle! which will add subtitle message
# If line starts with !bosbar:[name]-[timer]! then player will get bossbar message defined after this variable, in addition you can define how long this message will be visible. You need to define bossbar name which can be anything you want, but lines with same name will override each other to prevent stacking
# To include clickable messages: <T>Text</T><H>Hover text</H><C>command</C><SC>Suggested text</SC>
# <T> and </T> required, other is optional
# Use /n to break line
# To have more than one JSON message use <Next>
# <C> performs command as a player who clicked
# <CC> performs command from console once
# <CCI> performs command from console every time player clicks text
# <URL> includes url
info:
  # Use !prefix! in any locale line to automatically include this prefix
